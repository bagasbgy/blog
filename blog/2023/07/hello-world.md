This is one of my (many) blogging attempts, and the second one that use markdown as the writing medium. I used [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) in my previous blog since I mainly use R for my data science related tasks. After migrated to Python and React, I decided to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for its Static Site Generator (SSG) feature, which (after some hacking) could seamlessly support markdown and Jupyter Notebook as the page source&#8212;will definitely share my experience in developing this blog soon! ðŸ˜Ž
